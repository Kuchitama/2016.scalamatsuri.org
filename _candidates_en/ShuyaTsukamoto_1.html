<p>
In CyberAgent Ad Tech Studio, we develop ad delivery system(SSP) named ProFit-X. In that system, we realize asynchronous high speed processing by Spray + Akka actor. And we visualize and monitor that system's various metrics by Kamon + Datadog.

<p>
In this session, I will introduce what's merit, and what's demerit with those technologies from 1 year developments, operations, and monitorings. 
We prepare Kamon + Datadog's introduction article, in this session, I will develop the story from it.
