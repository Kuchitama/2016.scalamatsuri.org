<p>
We love coding in Scala. Playing with Scala and creating new thing with Scala excites and enriches our lives. There's no doubt that.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, in software development projects with compensation, the single tool may not be suited for all cases.
</p>
<p>
Even on the server-side programs, on a daily basis, I use other languages like Java and Ruby more often than Scala. For frontend too, we've used JavaScript, ES6, TypeScript, Sass, and other systems, depending on the requirements and what the team, by being flexible, and trying new things.

<p>
Using the right tool for the right job, is an important aspect of the craftmanship for me. We will exapand on this idea in this session, with examples from my experience.
