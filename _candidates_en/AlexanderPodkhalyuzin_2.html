<p>This talk will explore the internals of the Scala plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. We will start from the IntelliJ Platform API, and then move on to understanding the Scala type system and how it is implemented in the plugin. I will also shed some light on the darker corners and obscure algorithms of language.</p>

<p>In addition to a deeper understanding of Scala, you will discover how to implement something in a plugin or maybe just fix some annoying bugs. It can also help you implement other IntelliJ IDEA plugins that add some new syntax to the language according to your custom Scala compiler plugin.</p>
