<p>
Actor Programming in Scala, introduced by Akka, enabled to implement high-performance and highly-durable concurrent processing. However, although Scala is a statically typed language, the type signature of the method `receive` in Akka Actor is `PartialFunction[Any, Unit]`, which makes lots of Scala users feel disappointed.

Do you know the new language, Pony, catching great attention recently? Pony satisfies desirable features for robust concurrent programming, such as Actor-oriented, strongly type safe, memory safe, no runtime exceptions, data-race free, and deadlock free. In this talk, I will introduce the overview of Pony, with comparison to Scala & Akka.
