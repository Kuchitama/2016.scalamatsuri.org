<p>
Even if you start out as a single web service, with adding related services, mobile application, and admin screens for the staff, we often end up with multiple projects (and repos) in appearance, but tightly coupled inside: a scary spaghetti monster! We've all seen this.
</p>
<p>
Facing such reality, we've made the decision to transform our monolithic, legacy services into microservices written in Scala. I'd like to share how great microservice is, how Scala (especially Akka Actors) fit it, and some roadblocks we've hit along the way (and their workarounds).
</p>
<p>
The outline would be:
<ul>
<li>Challenges we've had</li>
<li>What microservice can and can't solve </li>
<li>Background into adopting Scala</li>
<li>why we could make the leap with zero Scala experience</li>
</ul>
</p>
