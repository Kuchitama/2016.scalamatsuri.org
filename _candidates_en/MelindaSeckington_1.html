<p>As developers, we’re constantly learning: whether it’s figuring out how to solve new problems and bugs, or focusing on new skills and knowledge to apply to our work.
  At FutureLearn, we reflect our company mission of providing the best learning experiences to everyone, within the way we work as well.
  We have a culture of learning and supporting each other, encouraging everyone to pursue the skills they want to have.
</p>
<p>This talk will help you make learning a more integral part of your processes, and explain how to run internal events, like hackdays and lightning talks, to support this.</p>
