<p>Since original iPhone launched in 2007, Apple was asking developers to use their Objective-C language to make iPhone applications.</p>
<p>In June 2014, that situation was drastically changed in good way for us -- Swift language. A new shiny functional programing language, Swift has many similarities to Scala like mixture of functional and objective oriented style etc.</p>
<p>As experiences of both working on backend services in Scala and iOS applications for many years at Twitter who loves Scala a lot, I'll give a presentation that invites you all to iOS world with Scala.</p>
