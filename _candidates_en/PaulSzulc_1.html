<p>Martin Thomson said “There is a lot of folklore beliefs. I define it as ‘The fanboi problem’. People jump on ideas and they believe it blindly”. Those happen to pop up in Scala world as well. You’ve probably heard at least one of them before. There is also a lot of ignorance as well. Have you ever wondered how lambdas are implemented or how Nothing is represented in the JVM? How did they manage to create traits in the single-inheritance environment?
And most important question, those above really matter?</p>
<p>We will learn JVM bytecode and then apply that knowledge, to answer above.</p>
