<p>
Scala.js is a JavaScript Compiler, which uses Scala as it's source. There also exists TypeScript, which is recognized as a typed superset of JavaScript. I, who have used TypeScript for more than 2 years both in private and at work, would like to show the attractiveness and difficulties of Scala.js comparing to TypeScript.
