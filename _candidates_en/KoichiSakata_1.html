<p>Scala, like Java and all other JVM languages, transforms programs into the JVM bytecode through compilation, as you probably know. However, the bytecode instructions have been designed only with Java in mind (with one exception), and not all other languages.
The fact that the JVM is capable of hosting many languages speaks volume of its excellent design (and its implementation).</p>
<p>In this session, we will depart from Scala itself for a while, and focus on how a piece of Scala code compiles, and executes on the JVM.
The intended audience is those who are not familiar with the JVM or the bytecode. No prior knowledge should be needed as we will talk through the JVM and its instructions first. Next, let's find out how typical constructs in Scala are expressed in the bytecode!</p>
