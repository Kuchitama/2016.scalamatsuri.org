<p>"Big Data" doesn't just mean large volumes. It also means flexible approaches to working with data sets of any size. It also means working with data quickly.</p>

<p>Functional programming is the source of the flexible abstractions we need, because working with data is doing Mathematics, the basis of FP. Because of Scala's basis in FP, its general flexibility, and its JVM roots, it has become a standard for Big Data programming. In fact, Big Data projects are driving Scala adoption right now. This talk shows you why.</p>

<p>We'll see examples using popular tools like Spark, Kafka, and Algebird.</p>
