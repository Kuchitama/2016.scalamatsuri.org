A Lens is a functional concept that permits to zoom in a data structure.
A key point of Lenses is that they compose together such as you can drill deeper and deeper in your data.
Once you arrive at the level you are interested in, you can either extract or modify (even effectfully!) the value you targeted.

In this presentation, I would like to go through a specific Lens implementation known as Van Laarhoven Lenses.
</p>
<p>
This implementation is particularly interesting because it defines Lenses as a unique function!
The game is to find out how can we derive all Lens methods from this simple function
