<p>
Based on the fact that it's fun to make strange sound from a computer, I'll share my story of building a modular synthesizer in Scala.
I plan to talk about composing components with multiple inputs and multiple output in a Scala-like way using functional reactive programming (FRP) and Arrows, how to handle high-precision realtime events, optimization without breaking abstraction, DSL to describe complex composition in a readable way, and the fundamentals of modular synthesizer and voice processing.
