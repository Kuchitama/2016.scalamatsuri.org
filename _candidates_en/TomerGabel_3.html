<p>So you've heard of this newfangled "Scala" thing and think it's worth checking out. Good for you! Unfortunately, it's also daunting. Your first search is likely to pitch Scala as a "statically-typed hybrid object-oriented and functional language", which is technically true but doesn't really help much.
