<p>
Most game engines have a main loop that renders a frame and performs a callback on each iteration. But games are essentially processes, and it is unnatural to describe them frame-by-frame. Non-trivial games often end up in complex state machines and callback hell.

<p>
It would be better to code on the process level. This is possible in SubScript, an extension to Scala that is based on a mathematical theory called the Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP). In several examples we show how SubScript-based game engine describes games as processes in terms of nice mathematical expressions.
