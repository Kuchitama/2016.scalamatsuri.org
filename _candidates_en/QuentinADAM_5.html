<p>
Postgres SQL is a plain old SQL DB. Very powerful and very consistent, in some case, project needs an ACID database, but schemaless... With JSON support, Postgres is a very interesting tool to provide ACID and some very interesting function (time management, localisation function and data types...) and the schemaless noSQL point of view with json and indexed json. This talk show some great usage and some insight to build some great application with Postgres.
