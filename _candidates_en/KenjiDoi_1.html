<p>
Lodeo, an ad network for videos, was developed by a group of Scala beginners: 6 total with zero experience, and with 4 with less than a half year of Scala experience.
In this session, I would like to share our experience of developing Lodeo in Scala by comparing early phase of the project to middle phase of it with 2 beginners, and introduce good/bad practices of the development.

The following is the outline:

<ul>
<li>Converting from Java to Scala</li>
<li>Helpful tips on writing comments for the PR reviews</li>
<li>The scalaz dispute at Lodeo</li>
</ul>
