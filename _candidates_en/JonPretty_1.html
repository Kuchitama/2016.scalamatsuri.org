<p>Scala lets us enforce compile-time constraints on our programs, and we can use these to reason about our code. Yet we still often encounter situations - like getting a value from a Map - where we have no guarantee that the operation will be successful. With dependent types we can make many of these cases completely safe by construction, eliminating entire classes of errors. Most importantly, we can do this without complicating user code. Additionally, with more precise type information available at compile time, we elicit the exciting opportunity to use it to optimize performance at runtime.</p>
