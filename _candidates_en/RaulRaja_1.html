<p>In this talk we will see a pragmatic approach to building a purely functional architecture that delivers cohesive functional components.</p>
<p>We will cover functional patterns such as Monads, Transformers, Kleisli, Dependently typed checked exceptions and types as well as how they can be glued together to achieve pure functions that are composable, context free, dependently injectable and testable.</p>
