<p>
The warriors fight using your code!
</p>
<p>
We have been thinking that Scala lacks educational material, so we started working on a project called scala-warrior, a Scala learning tool that uses gamification, developed in opensource. Of course scala-warrior itself is developed in Scala using Play and Scala.js.
</p>
<p>
In this session, we would like to introduce scala-warriors to you for the first time. We would also like to discuss challenges facing the adoption of Scala, and some of the technical details of scala-warrior especially Scala.js.
