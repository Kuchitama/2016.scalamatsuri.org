<p>I'd like to share my story as a long-time Ruby developer studying Scala and introducing it at work for our batch system in a matter of three months. Given my Ruby background, I was at first torn between Jruby and Scala. I will compare them in terms of the language and their performance, and share my reason of why I ultimately chose Scala.</p>
