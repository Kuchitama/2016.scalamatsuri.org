Akka Stream 1.0 was released in July, 2015.
In this session, I would like to share my experience of developing a batch processing with log files as the input, and also another sequential processing that uses the messages thrown into Amazon Kinesis as the input. In particular, we will look into initial pitfalls, what's possible, and what's not possible with Akka Stream.
