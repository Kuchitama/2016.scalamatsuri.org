One of the challenges in designing DBMS is its storage format. What is the best way to manage data inside memory and disks? How to reduce the migration cost when the schema is changed? Our answer is MessagePack. In this talk, I will present the basic architecture of the MessagePack-based DBMS, and how Scala's powerful features (e.g., pattern matching, macros, etc.) make its implementation simple.
