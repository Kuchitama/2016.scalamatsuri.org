In July 2015, released version 1.0 of Akka-Stream.
In this session, I will introduce difficult point in start-up, what Akka-Stream can do, and what it can't do.
From development experience of batch processing for log files and stream processing for putted messages of Amazon Kinesis using Akka-Stream.
