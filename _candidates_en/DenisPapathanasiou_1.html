<p>
This talk is a practical introduction to using graph databases in scala, with several examples and useful code snippets.
</p>
<p>
In contrast with relational databases, graphs scale more naturally, and are easier to manage with large data sets.
</p>
<p>
Graphs also map more directly to several types of problem domains, such as Access controls, Recommendations, Logistics, Fraud detection, and Conversations. I will show examples for each.
</p>
<p>
Scala is an ideal language for graph processing, because it interacts seamlessly with gremlin, the standard graph query language.
