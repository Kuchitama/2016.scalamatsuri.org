<p>In June 2014, Apple introduced Swift: a new development language that made iOS/OSX developers able to play with several FP concepts.</p>
<p>Working in 47 Degrees, a company specialized in Scala development, I realized that there are still many gaps to cover between both worlds. That's why we're developing Second Bridge, an open-source Swift framework that aims to bring FP to iOS/OSX developers while making Swift development confortable to Scala developers.</p>
<p>I'd love to tell you about it, and lend you a hand to bring your Functional Programming knowledge to one of the most profitable markets to date.</p>
