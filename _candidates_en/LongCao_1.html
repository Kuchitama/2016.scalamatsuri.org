<p>There are many ways to approach error handling in Scala, some of which will look more familiar to those coming from Java backgrounds, and some that are more familiar to those coming from the functional programming side. In this talk, we'll explore refactoring your error handling code from Java-like Scala to a more functional style. We'll also take a brief look at some of the already existing constructs for functional error handling and error accumulation in the Scala ecosystem.</p>
