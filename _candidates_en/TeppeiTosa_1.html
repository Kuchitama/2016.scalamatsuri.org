<p>GraphX, an Apache Spark component, is a framewrok for processing graph data structure. Graph computation is a powerful technique that enables kinds of analysis not possible with typical table-like data processing. Since GraphX is available only for Scala implementation, this is a weapon exclusive to Scala engineers. In this session we will go over what's possible with GraphX, how the implementation would look like, and how we can vizualize the data using Apache Zeppelin.</p>
