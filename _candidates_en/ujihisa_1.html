<p>
Hootsuite is a web service written in PHP that was created in 2008, and since 2012 we have been using Scala for some parts of the system.
And currently, we basically use Scala for all our new features.
In this session, I will share some of the lessons learned using one of the internal services we developed as an example.

<ul>
<li>Do's and Don'ts of splitting a monolithic app</li>
<li>How to migrate systems with zero downtime</li>
<li>From PHP to Scala; then from Old Scala to Newer Scala</li>
<li>Scala-specific pros and cons</li>
</ul>
