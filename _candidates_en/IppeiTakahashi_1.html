<p>
In our team, we use Play framework, Slick, and Scalaz for new product's server side implementation.
Slick after version 3.0 returns DB operation result by Future. And it can use Either for error handling. They are convenient, but they could be negative factor for code's readability. Monad and Monad transformer provided by Scalaz are useful for data operation wrapped by context(Future, Either etc..), and they aid high readable code what uses "for" operator.

In this session, I will introduce practical technique for product developping know-how by functional coding and unit testing referenced to the example, migration for Play framework 2.4 and Slick 3.0 and Scalaz introduction following migrations.
I hope that this session will help people who want to introduce Scala for product development.
