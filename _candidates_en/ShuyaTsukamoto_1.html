At CyberAgent Ad Tech Studio, we have been developing an ad delivery system (supply-side platform, or SSP) named ProFit-X. With Spray and Akka actors, the system is capable of asynchronous high speed processing. Additionally, various metrics from the system is monitored and visualized using Kamon and Datadog.

In this session, I will present the pros and cons of the above technology that we learned from one year of development, operation, and monitoring.
As for Kamon and Datadog, I've prepared an introductory article. The session will develop the story from it.
