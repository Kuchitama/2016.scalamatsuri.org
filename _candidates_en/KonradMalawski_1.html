<p>Over the last more than a year of development, the Akka team has focused nearly entirely on Akka Streams, a well-typed back-pressured stream processing abstraction. In this talk we'll talk about the decisions made that impacted the design of the 1.x series of Akka Streams and how the underlying implementation actually works. In this rather practical session, we will talk about using back-pressure to implement smart data-collapsing pipelines as well as implementing custom processing stages using the built in stage / merge / route elements.</p>
