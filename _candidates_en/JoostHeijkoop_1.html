<p>When doing event sourcing with Akka actors, maintaining the persistence in an evolving system can be hard and tedious, when using contemporary persisting solutions. You will always run into migration issue when you want to update your domain models and generated event that have already been stored in production.</p>
<p>People have already "solved" the migrations, but solutions aren't particularly elegant and can be error prone. You are missing an abstraction: Stamina.</p>
<p>This talk will show Akka Persistence together with Stamina, so that your persisting and migrating becomes easy as cake!</p>
