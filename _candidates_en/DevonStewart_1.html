<p>
Follow decisions, techniques, and goals, as we try to refactor from the Typesafe Stack to a more purely functional codebase. Topics covered will include Encoding safety into the typesystem, refactoring out common typeclasses, and effective modeling of state using sealed traits.
</p>
<p>
An understanding of purely functional practices (Haskell, scalaz) is not required, concepts will be explained with examples.
