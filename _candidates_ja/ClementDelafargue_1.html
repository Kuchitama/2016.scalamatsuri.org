<p>Scala, by being both Functional and Object-Oriented is easy to get started
with, especially for java developers. However, to get the most of the
language, you have to embrace its functional nature.</p>

<p>In this session, I'll show you how to start using scala's functional nature by
presenting patterns originated in the functional world:</p>

<ul>
<li>Algebraic Data Types for data modelling</li>
<li>Typeclasses for extensible abstractions</li>
<li>Error handling in a composable fashion with Either and Validation</li>
<li>Segregation between logic and effects for easier testing</li>
<li>Property based testing</li>
</ul>
