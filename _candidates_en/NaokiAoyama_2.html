<p>
At Maverick., inc., we adopted Scala from establishment at October 2013, and develop DSP ad delivery system named Spchere. In this fiscal year, we executed large-scale system refurbishment with the aim to paying off technical debt for flexibility of future changing and updating into microservices.

<p>
In this session, I will talk tips of large-scale system refurbishment developed by Scala with the history of change of environments surrounding Scala from 2013 to 2015.
