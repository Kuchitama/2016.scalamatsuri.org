<p>
Clojure is often compared with Scala among the programming languages that run on JVM.
Certainly, Clojure is a dynamically-typed language by default, and many get a different impression from Scala, which is rather strict about the types. However, by constrasting them side by side we can also find many commonalities between them.
Perhaps it's because both are often categorized under the umbrella of "functional programming language."

In this talk we will discuss "functional programming" by looking at those commonalities with the presenter, who uses Clojure at work, but studies Scala for fun.
