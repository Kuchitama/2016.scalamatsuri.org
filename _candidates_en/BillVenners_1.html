<p>
  In this talk I'll demonstrate new features of ScalaTest 3.0, show how you can take advantage of them, and tell the story of how we arrived at the design.
  I'll show Scala.js support, the Assertion result type, and in particular: asynchronous tests.
  Async tests allow you to map assertions onto an existing future, yielding a Future[Assertion] that you can return to ScalaTest.
  Async tests are required for Scala.js, where you can't block.
  On the JVM they allow you to write non-blocking tests that are consistent with non-blocking production code as encouraged by frameworks like Akka and Play.
