<p>I've joined Septeni Original, Inc about two years ago,
and started introducing Scala to the organization.
We now have most of our products (about five) in Scala.</p>
<p>This session is aimed for engineers interested in adopting Scala, and managers wishing to improve the development level in the organization. We will cover various topics that I came across while spreading Scala in my organization such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical context for Scala adoption (or an epic of pride and hardship of developing a famous live broadcasting service)</li>
<li>Steps for Scala adoption</li>
<li>Resulting culture after Scala adoption</li>
<li>The education process</li>
<li>What side effects did we observe</li>
</ul>
