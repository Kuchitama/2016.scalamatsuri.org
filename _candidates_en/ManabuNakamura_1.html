<p>How should we utilize Scala's object-oriented style, functional programming style, and its rich type system in our production code?
In this session, I will illustrate pragmatic uses of Scala through refactoring some of the typical patterns that arise in many projects.</p>
<p>The target audience of this session are those who have a decent grasp on Scala's syntax and features, but still strugling to use it in practice.</p>
