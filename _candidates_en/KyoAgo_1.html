<p>"You'll be using Scala in your new job."</p>
<p>The work that I joined mainly used Scala, so as a JavaScript engineer, I have been working in the shadows.</p>
<p>How does the Scala world look like from someone like me?</p>
<p>And, what did I do to survive it?</p>
<p>Hopefully this talk will be interesting to the Scala engineers interested in adopting Scala.js for the front end.</p>
