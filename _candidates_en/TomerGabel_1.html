<p>New Scala practitioners often experience the uncomfortable feeling of "not quite getting it." If you've studied the syntax and written tests, maybe production code; if you're becoming comfortable with the language and libraries, but keep worrying that there's "a better way", or that your code isn't "idiomatic enough" - this session is for you.</p>
<p>By refactoring a real, live codebase, this talk will provide you with new tools and increased confidence. Between the provided examples and the ensuing discussion, you will walk away with a better feel for Scala and how to employ it in the real world.</p>
