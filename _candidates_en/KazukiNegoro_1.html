<p>
I'd like to share a case study of 100x performance improvement of a batch processing by switching to Akka Streams.
We used to have a problematic batch processing that's in production. We re-implemented it using Akka Streams and Slick, and were able to achieve massive improvement in the performance without any change the hardware.
I'll show the usage of Akka Stream using this as a case study.
