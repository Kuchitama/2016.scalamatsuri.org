<p>
Maverick., inc. adopted Scala from the establishment of our company in October 2013 and develop Sphere, the ad delivery system (DSP). And we have re-architected the large part of our system to pay off the technical debt and adopt microservice architectures in this year.

<p>
In this session, I will share tips of large-scale rearchitecture of the Scala system with looking back on the history of the environment surrounding Scala from 2013 to 2015.
