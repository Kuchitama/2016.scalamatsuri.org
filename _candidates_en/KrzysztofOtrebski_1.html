<p>Does anyone remember the game "Missile Command" on Atari? I bet you know it or played some kind of clone.</p>
<p>During this session I would like to simulate missile defence system and protect planet Earth from hostile aliens.
Under the hood there will be Scala and Akka. Akka is a great toolkit for creating reactive applications, but it shows its full capabilities if it is run as a cluster. I will simulate network and power failures to provide some idea how fast it can recover.</p>
