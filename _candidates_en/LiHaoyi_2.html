<p>Scala does not have a good filesystem API. You have the half-broken scala.io.Source class, the vaporware scalax.io project, the clunky java.{io, nio} packages, and a dozen undocumented, half-baked mini-filesystem-libraries in scalac, SBT, and others.</p>

<p>This does not need to be the case. I will present Ammonite-Ops, a filesystem library with the convenience, stability and documentation that you can actually use it in your own projects. Using Ammonite-Ops, we'll explore how previously verbose and inconvenient filesystem tasks become simple, convenient and concise.</p>
