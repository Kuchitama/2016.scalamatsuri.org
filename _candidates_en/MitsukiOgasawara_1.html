<p>
When picking the programming language for so-called "Data Science" such as machine learning and statistics, some of the important factors are the availability of ML/statistics libraries, and how the language is suited for common tasks such as pre-processing and visualization.
</p>
<p>
Python has its eco-system for ML and Statistics, for instance Pandas and scikit-learn.
On the other hand, Scala also has strength in Big Data processing, like Spark and Scalding.
</p>
<p>
This talk will introduce pros and cons of using Scala in the data science field,
by comparing implementations of Matrix Factorization (an algorithm for recomendation system) in Scala and Python (Cython).
Additionaly, I will also show the selection criteria and what is missing in current Scala eco-system.
