<p>Some people say SBT is immutable, functional, and beautifully elegant. Others claim it's a crazy, confusing mess where cargo-cult copy-pasting is the only way to survive. And they're both right!</p>
<p>This talk will explore the architecture of SBT, from the vantage point of a library writer. We will compare it to the design of other libraries in the Scala ecosystem, large and small, contrasting the way they provide their functionality to the end-user.</p>
<p>Finally, we will aim to answer the simple question: how can such an immutable, functional, elegant library be so utterly confusing?</p>
