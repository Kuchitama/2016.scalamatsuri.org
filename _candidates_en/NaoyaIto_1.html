<p>
Elixir is a dyanamically typed functional programming language that runs on Erlang VM.
Doesn't it remind you of the description of Scala (... that runs on Java VM)?
</p>
<p>
Elixir inherits many of its feature from Erlang/OTP, including pattern matching and
parallel processing using the Actor model, which should be familiar to the Scala programmers.
</p>
<p>
The recent buzz is that Elixir might be the next big language for web development in 2015.
How does it actually live up to it?
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I will introduce Elixir to you Scala programmers. Let's see how you'd react!
