<p>
This a case study of using familar Java libraries from Scala:

<ul>
<li>Handling nulls.</li>
<li>Make Java do the dirty jobs (casting, reflection, etc)</li>
<li>Using Java libraries from Scala</li>
<li>Keeping Java only for ORM (For those tired of immutability in Scala)</li>
<li>Using Scala with other scripting languages</li>
</ul>
