<p>Domain modeling is usually implemented using OO design.
In this talk we will take a different approach using Scala:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with focus on verbs first</li>
<li>Think how we can model domain behaviors using pure functions grouped within extensible modules </li>
<li>Use an algebraic approach towards evolution of modules,the algebra being composed of functions,types & laws</li>
<li>See how the domain algebra can be constructed from categorical structures like monoids, functors & monads </li>
<li>Discuss how the functional patterns lead to compositionality - an extremely important quality that scales your domain model.</li>
</ol>
