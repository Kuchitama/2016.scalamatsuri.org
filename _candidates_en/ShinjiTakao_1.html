<p>Various programming languages not just Java are run on Java VM. Of course, Scala is one of them.</p>

<p>You need not to know how the memory is managed in Java VM in most cases, but it would be helpful in case anything happens. I would like to introduce "HeapStats", the open-sourced monitoring and analysis tool for Java VM, to provide against such cases.</p>
