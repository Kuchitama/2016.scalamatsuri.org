<p>
Statically typed languages have a bad reputation as painfully verbose.
A meager hello world in Java requires 129 characters and 5 lines of code.
</p>
<p>
Scala is the static language that feels dynamic.
With its powerful, flexible, and expressive syntax, concise yet not terse, a single line of Scala code can leverage an impressive amount of JVM power.</p>
<p>
In this fun, engaging, and interactive live code presentation (done entirely in the Scala REPL) I show you some of the most powerful and elegant Scala one-liners that give us dynamic productivity in a static language.
