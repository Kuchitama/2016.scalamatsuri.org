Everybody has something about streams on scala platform : Iteratee, scalaz.streams, Reactive streams, akka.io, akka streamsâ€¦
But is it usefull for day to day developper job? Is it only for database drivers? What is the differences between all this technologies?
So, why you need streams in your app, understand what is it and use it in real world.

I use streaming on top of scala platform for years and learn a lot in real world project arround iteratee, and akka stream using event store, persistence, rabbitMQ and HTTP...
so real world code show and demo and real use case for day to day projects.
