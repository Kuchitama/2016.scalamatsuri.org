Resilience; most developers understand what the word means, but way too many lack a deeper understanding of what it really means in the context of the system that they are working on now. I find it really sad to see, since understanding and managing failure is more important today than ever. Outages are incredibly costly—for many definitions of cost—and can sometimes take down whole businesses. In this talk we will explore the essence of resilience. We will see that everything hints at the same conclusion; there is no "happy path", failure is an option and resilience is by design.
