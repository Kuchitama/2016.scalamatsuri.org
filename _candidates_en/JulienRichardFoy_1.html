<p>Writing a program consists in expressing the solution of a given problem in a language that can be understood by both computers and humans. Thus, a programming language should provide means of expressing a problem domain and its solution. Furthermore, it should also provide answers to engineering concerns: how to break down a complex problem into several simpler problems? How to make the code reusable? How to keep the language simple while addressing these concerns?</p>
<p>This talk presents how to teach Scala in a way that helps to build a simple, robust and coherent vision of the language.</p>
