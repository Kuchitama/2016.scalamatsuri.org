<p>This session will illustrate how to implement a recommendation engine
using PredictionIO, an open source machine learning server written in Scala.
I will introduce a few case studies as well.</p>

<p>Because PredictionIO takes care from data collection to training and deployment,
together with Apache Spark MLlib, implementing a recommendation engine is a breeze
with some simple coding in Scala.
Since the architecture is based on Apache Spark and HBase, this a framework well suited for Big Data.</p>
