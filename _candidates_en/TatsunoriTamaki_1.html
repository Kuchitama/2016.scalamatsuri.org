<p>I'll illustrate how to implement ad-hoc polymorphism by defining typeclasses
using Scala's implicit parameter and implicit conversion.
I've set the level to "Intermediate," but since this is a basic functional programming
technique, it might be considered Beginner level for a functional programmer.
Those coming from the object-oriented background might discover something refreshing.</p>
