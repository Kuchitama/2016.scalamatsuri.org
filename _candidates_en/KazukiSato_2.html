<p>
Both microservice architecture and Scala are now on the upward trend.
There are many services adopting Scala, going microservice, and even trying both at once. Many of them just say Scala, so it's unclear what web framework they are using, or they are often using Play.
We use spray instead. We don't hear about it as much, but it fits really nicely with microservices. In this session, I'll make a case for using spray instead of the popular Play. How about you give it a try too?
