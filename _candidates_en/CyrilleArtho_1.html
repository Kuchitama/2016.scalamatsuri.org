<p>Tired of writing unit tests one by one? Model-based testing can generate thousands of diverse unit tests from one simple model.</p>
<p>Modbat makes it easy to write models thanks to its Scala-based domain-specific language. Modbat has been used on very diverse projects: parts of Java (where it found bugs), complex logical solvers written in C, and Apache ZooKeeper.</p>
<p>We give a quick tour and demo through Modbat and show its versatility, so you can try it out later on your own (Scala, Java, C) code.</p>
