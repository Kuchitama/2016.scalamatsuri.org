<p>Many of us have been sold on the benefits of pure functional programming, though we often get stuck on how to do this in our webapps. We isolate our side-effects to a degree but our "pure" functions become polluted by calls to the database or network. Testing then becomes hard and we have to resort to elaborate mocks.</p>
<p>The "Interpreter" pattern allows a total separation between your functions and the effects by having your code declare the effects and the interpreter run them. This a pattern that novice functional programmers have been able to understand and use. We will explore the Free monad.</p>
