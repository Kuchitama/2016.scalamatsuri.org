<p>
It is often a tough issue how to maintain the interfaces in a growing system. IDL can resolve this issue. For example, it enables to unify the data model in a system by defining interfaces at one place, and generating codes in another language, like in Scala for server side and in JavaScript for client side. In this talk, I will show some practical examples using Thrift + Scrooge + Finagle + Play Framework, and also introduce other IDLs in Scala.
