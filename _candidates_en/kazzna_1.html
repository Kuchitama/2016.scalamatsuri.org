In this session, I will explain Option to the developers who uses (or will use) Scala as a better Java: where can we apply it, how can we use it and things that it can't be applied.

As I try to make my presentation be the easiest one in ScalaMatsuri, feel free to join even if you are a beginner of Scala.
