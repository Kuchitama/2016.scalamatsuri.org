<p>
Elixir is a dynamically typed functional programming language that runs on Erlang VM.
Doesn't it remind you of the description of Scala (... that runs on Java VM)?
</p>
<p>
Elixir inherits many of its feature from Erlang/OTP, including pattern matching and
parallel processing using the Actor model, which should be familiar to the Scala programmers.
On the other hand, there are some differences between stemming from the fact that Scala is statically type checked, and Elixir is dyanmically type checked. For example, the application of the pattern matching is much more prevalent in terms of the language design, because of its dynamically typed nature.</p>
<p>
The recent buzz is that Elixir might be the next big language for web development in 2015.
How does it actually live up to it?
</p>
<p>
In this talk, I will introduce Elixir comparing it to Scala. Let's see how you Scala programmers react!
I think it'll be great not just for serious usages, but also for casually trying out functional programming or actors if you're coming from Scala.
