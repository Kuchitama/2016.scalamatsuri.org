<p>
In case of choosing the language to deal with "Data Science" such as ML and Statistics, it is important that the language has the features, for example, availability of library for ML and Statistics, and easeness of programming for pre-processing and visualization.
</p>
<p>
Python has its eco-system for ML and Statistics, for instance Pandas and scikit-learn.
On the other hand, Scala also has strength in Big Data processing, like Spark and Scalding.
</p>
<p>
This talk will introduce pros and cons in using Scala for Data Science, by comparing the implementation of Matrix Factorization in Scala and the one in Python(Cython), which is a kind of a algorithm for recomendation. Additionaly, I will also show the selection criteria and what is missing in current Scala eco-system.
