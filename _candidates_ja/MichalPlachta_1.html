<p>Writing distributed applications is very hard. Programmers tend to focus on functionalities first, leaving the scalability issues for later. Fortunately, Akka gives us many tools for scaling out and we can use them very early in the development process. You will learn how to take advantage of these features.</p>

<p>If you are interested in scalability, this talk is for you. First, I will create a single-noded app. Then we will talk about scalability and availability problems with this approach and introduce sharding as potential solution and transform our app into more scalable one.</p>
