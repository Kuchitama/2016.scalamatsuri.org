<p>Many Scala serialization libraries use type classes to translate between typed values and their encoding.</p>
<p>Libraries provide instances for ""standard"" types and ways of combining them. Library users write instances for their own types in terms of those: a time consuming and laborious, but also mechanical process, based entirely on the structure of the types.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if we could persuade the Scala compiler to use the structure of those types to do the work for us?</p>
<p>Building on shapeless's core generic programming primitives and support for automatic type class derivation we can!</p>
