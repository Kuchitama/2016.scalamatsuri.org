<p>As Scala engineers we are all familiar with the combinators that are provided to us by the standard library. With the addition of libraries like Scalaz and Cats, we forget that learning to program functionally is simpler than learning to use a purely functional library. These libraries are not their own end- they are powerful tools that we should utilize to help us program functionally.  Functional programming is about simpler concepts than monads and monoids- it's about referential transparency and purity.</p>
