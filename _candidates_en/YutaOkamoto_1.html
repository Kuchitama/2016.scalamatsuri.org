<p>"Reactive" is now attracting the attention in various fields from the programming model to the architecture of distributed systems. ReactiveX, the asynchronous streaming API, and Reactive Manifesto, the design principles of large-scale systems promoted by Typesafe, are both famous examples of the reactive technologies.</p>

<p>And the language standard is now starting to accept the reactiveness. Java 9 plans to add the specification of asynchronous back-pressure, Reactive Streams, to its standard library.</p>

<p>However, why does every technology coming from the completely different background need similar concept? "Why Functional Programming Matters" written by John Hughes in the 1980s will give you a hint.</p>

<p>In this session, I would like to look at "why reactive matters" as a means of promoting modularity of our code, system and organization.</p>
