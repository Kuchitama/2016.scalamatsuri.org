<p>
The annual Hatena internship has added a Scala curriculum from this year.
</p><p>
In this talk, I will go over my summer with interns, including
authoring an intern textbook from scratch, prior challenges,
on-boarding, and product development in the Mackerel team.
</p><p>
I hope to share some useful hints from our intership process on the engineer education,
which is becoming a hot topic as Scala spreads more widely.</p>
