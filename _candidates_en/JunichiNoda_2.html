<p>
In this session, I will walk through the steps to make a recommendation system that analyzes Twitter data using Scala and Spark MLlib.
In fifteen minutes, I will explain how to extract feature for each account, and answer questions like "What goods should we introduce to whom?" and "How do we develop such a system using Scala and Spark?"
