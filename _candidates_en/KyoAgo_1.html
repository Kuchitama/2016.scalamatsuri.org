<p>"What if a Javascript developer need to use Scala to survive in his company?"</p>
<p>I can explain it.</p>
<p>In my office, Scala is heavily used, and Javascript developers (including me) feeled ashamed, unworthy and even guilty for using Javascript, and lived hiddenly in the shadow of Scala's type-safety.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how Scala world is viewed from Javascript developer?</p>
<p>And, can you imagine what I did to survive?</p>
<p>I will show you it's detail. In addition, it's content should be interesting to Scala developers who want to use Scala.js as frontend. Don't miss it!!</p>
