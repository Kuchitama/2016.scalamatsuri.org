<p>(This is a condensed version of <a href="/en/candidates/MarconiLanna_1/">my 40 min talk</a>)</p>
<p>
Statically typed languages have a reputation as painfully verbose.
A hello world in Java requires 129 chars and 5 lines of code.
</p>
<p>
Scala is the static language that feels dynamic. With its powerful, flexible, and expressive syntax, concise yet not terse, a single line of Scala code can leverage an impressive amount of JVM power.
</p>
<p>
In this fun, engaging, and interactive live code presentation (done entirely in the Scala REPL) I show you some of the most powerful and elegant Scala one-liners that give us dynamic productivity in a static language.
