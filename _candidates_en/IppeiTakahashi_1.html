<p>
In our team, we use Play framework, Slick, and Scalaz on server side implementation for all of our new products.
Slick after version 3.0 returns DB operation result by Future. And it can use Either for error handling. They are convenient, but they could be negative factor for code's readability. Monad and Monad transformer provided by Scalaz are useful for data operation wrapped by context(Future, Either etc..), and they aid high readable code what uses "for" operator.

<p>
In this session, I will introduce practical techniques around designing and testing a product with functional code, using Play 2.4 and Slick 3.0 migration as the example, and walking through the code changes when introducing Scalaz.
I hope that this session will help people who want to introduce Scala for product development.
