<p>
In this talk we are going to show how you can benefit from our custom CRDT-based model, called OUR-Set, to distribute data replicas on client devices.
</p>
<p>
CRDTs resolve data conflicts locally, and this simplifies the synchronization between replicas and makes it robust in unreliable networks.
</p>
<p>
We show a basic implementation of OUR-Set (Observed, Updated, Removed) in Scala.
