<p>
Many functions in our programs can fail to return a value, for several reasons related to business or technology. Some people use exceptions to write code that react to these failures. But it is possible to take advantage of Scala's type system to do this in a more readable and reliable way. I will show why and how to use some neat algebraic data types like Option, Try and Either, as well as disjunction and validation from the Scalaz library and modes from Rapture. Errors management is way less painful when the compiler is able to help!
